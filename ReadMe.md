# US Census Data Cleaning and Analysis

This project is a guided exercise provided by Codecademy. The main goal is to practice data cleaning and manipulation using real data from the US Census. We combine multiple CSV data files and create Jupyter notebooks to explore and analyze the data.

## Project Overview

### Objectives

- **Data Cleaning**: Convert data into a usable format by removing unwanted characters and handling missing values.
- **Data Manipulation**: Combine and transform data from multiple CSV files.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze the cleaned data to extract meaningful insights.
